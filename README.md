This is a project for my seminar work for school. It's the first time I've coded something this big; before this, I only coded some very small games.
I made a Reversi board game, then implemented a Minimax algorithm and a very basic Q-learning algorithm (it can hardly be called that, but I might come back and improve it later).
Now, I'm making a neural network with PyTorch to learn from the data generated by the Minimax algorithm. The goal is to see how the quantity and quality of data influence the AI's performance.
I might post my seminar paper here when it's finished so the project is complete.
Anybody who finds this code useful, feel free to use it, even though it isn't perfect. 
Hope this helps someone!

Features:
    1.A complete Reversi board game.
    2.A classic Minimax algorithm to play against.
    3.A basic Q-learning algorithm (currently a work in progress that I may improve later).
    4.A PyTorch Neural Network designed to learn from data generated by the Minimax agent(not completed yet).
